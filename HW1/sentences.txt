alice's adventures wonderland lewis carroll millennium fulcrum edition 2.9 chapter rabbit-hole alice beginning get tired sitting sister bank, nothing do: twice peeped book sister reading, pictures conversations it, `and use book,' thought alice `without pictures conversation?'
considering mind (as well could, hot day made feel sleepy stupid), whether pleasure making daisy-chain would worth trouble getting picking daisies, suddenly white rabbit pink eyes ran close her.
nothing remarkable that; alice think much way hear rabbit say itself, `oh dear!
oh dear!
shall late!'
(when thought afterwards, occurred ought wondered this, time seemed quite natural); rabbit actually took watch waistcoat- pocket, looked it, hurried on, alice started feet, flashed across mind never seen rabbit either waistcoat-pocket, watch take it, burning curiosity, ran across field it, fortunately time see pop large rabbit-hole hedge.
another moment went alice it, never considering world get again.
rabbit-hole went straight like tunnel way, dipped suddenly down, suddenly alice moment think stopping found falling deep well.
either well deep, fell slowly, plenty time went look wonder going happen next.
first, tried look make coming to, dark see anything; looked sides well, noticed filled cupboards book-shelves; saw maps pictures hung upon pegs.
took jar one shelves passed; labelled `orange marmalade', great disappointment empty: like drop jar fear killing somebody, managed put one cupboards fell past it.
`well!'
thought alice herself, `after fall this, shall think nothing tumbling stairs!
brave they'll think home!
why, say anything it, even fell top house!'
(which likely true.)
down, down, down.
would fall never come end!
`i wonder many miles i've fallen time?'
said aloud.
`i must getting somewhere near centre earth.
let see: would four thousand miles down, think--' (for, see, alice learnt several things sort lessons schoolroom, though good opportunity showing knowledge, one listen her, still good practice say over) `--yes, that's right distance--but wonder latitude longitude i've got to?'
(alice idea latitude was, longitude either, thought nice grand words say.)
presently began again.
`i wonder shall fall right earth!
funny it'll seem come among people walk heads downward!
antipathies, think--' (she rather glad one listening, time, sound right word) `--but shall ask name country is, know.
please, ma'am, new zealand australia?'
(and tried curtsey spoke--fancy curtseying falling air!
think could manage it?)
`and ignorant little girl she'll think asking!
no, it'll never ask: perhaps shall see written somewhere.'
down, down, down.
nothing else do, alice soon began talking again.
`dinah'll miss much to-night, think!'
(dinah cat.)
`i hope they'll remember saucer milk tea-time.
dinah dear!
wish me!
mice air, i'm afraid, might catch bat, that's like mouse, know.
cats eat bats, wonder?'
alice began get rather sleepy, went saying herself, dreamy sort way, `do cats eat bats?
cats eat bats?'
sometimes, `do bats eat cats?'
for, see, answer either question, much matter way put it.
felt dozing off, begun dream walking hand hand dinah, saying earnestly, `now, dinah, tell truth: ever eat bat?'
suddenly, thump!
thump!
came upon heap sticks dry leaves, fall over.
alice bit hurt, jumped feet moment: looked up, dark overhead; another long passage, white rabbit still sight, hurrying it.
moment lost: away went alice like wind, time hear say, turned corner, `oh ears whiskers, late getting!'
close behind turned corner, rabbit longer seen: found long, low hall, lit row lamps hanging roof.
doors round hall, locked; alice way one side other, trying every door, walked sadly middle, wondering ever get again.
suddenly came upon little three-legged table, made solid glass; nothing except tiny golden key, alice's first thought might belong one doors hall; but, alas!
either locks large, key small, rate would open them.
however, second time round, came upon low curtain noticed before, behind little door fifteen inches high: tried little golden key lock, great delight fitted!
alice opened door found led small passage, much larger rat-hole: knelt looked along passage loveliest garden ever saw.
longed get dark hall, wander among beds bright flowers cool fountains, could even get head though doorway; `and even head would go through,' thought poor alice, `it would little use without shoulders.
oh, wish could shut like telescope!
think could, know begin.'
for, see, many out-of-the-way things happened lately, alice begun think things indeed really impossible.
seemed use waiting little door, went back table, half hoping might find another key it, rate book rules shutting people like telescopes: time found little bottle it, (`which certainly before,' said alice,) round neck bottle paper label, words `drink me' beautifully printed large letters.
well say `drink me,' wise little alice going hurry.
`no, i'll look first,' said, `and see whether marked "poison" not'; read several nice little histories children got burnt, eaten wild beasts unpleasant things, would remember simple rules friends taught them: as, red-hot poker burn hold long; cut finger deeply knife, usually bleeds; never forgotten that, drink much bottle marked `poison,' almost certain disagree you, sooner later.
however, bottle marked `poison,' alice ventured taste it, finding nice, (it had, fact, sort mixed flavour cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, hot buttered toast,) soon finished off.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * `what curious feeling!'
said alice; `i must shutting like telescope.'
indeed: ten inches high, face brightened thought right size going though little door lovely garden.
first, however, waited minutes see going shrink further: felt little nervous this; `for might end, know,' said alice herself, `in going altogether, like candle.
wonder like then?'
tried fancy flame candle like candle blown out, could remember ever seen thing.
while, finding nothing happened, decided going garden once; but, alas poor alice!
got door, found forgotten little golden key, went back table it, found could possibly reach it: could see quite plainly glass, tried best climb one legs table, slippery; tired trying, poor little thing sat cried.
`come, there's use crying like that!'
said alice herself, rather sharply; `i advise leave minute!'
generally gave good advice, (though seldom followed it), sometimes scolded severely bring tears eyes; remembered trying box ears cheated game croquet playing herself, curious child fond pretending two people.
`but use now,' thought poor alice, `to pretend two people!
why, there's hardly enough left make one respectable person!'
soon eye fell little glass box lying table: opened it, found small cake, words `eat me' beautifully marked currants.
`well, i'll eat it,' said alice, `and makes grow larger, reach key; makes grow smaller, creep door; either way i'll get garden, care happens!'
ate little bit, said anxiously herself, `which way?
way?
', holding hand top head feel way growing, quite surprised find remained size: sure, generally happens one eats cake, alice got much way expecting nothing out-of-the-way things happen, seemed quite dull stupid life go common way.
set work, soon finished cake.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * chapter ii pool tears `curiouser curiouser!'
cried alice (she much surprised, moment quite forgot speak good english); `now i'm opening like largest telescope ever was!
good-bye, feet!'
(for looked feet, seemed almost sight, getting far off).
`oh, poor little feet, wonder put shoes stockings now, dears?
i'm sure _i_ able!
shall great deal far trouble you: must manage best way can; --but must kind them,' thought alice, `or perhaps walk way want go!
let see: i'll give new pair boots every christmas.'
went planning would manage it.
`they must go carrier,' thought; `and funny it'll seem, sending presents one's feet!
odd directions look!
alice's right foot, esq.
hearthrug, near fender, (with alice's love).
oh dear, nonsense i'm talking!'
head struck roof hall: fact nine feet high, took little golden key hurried garden door.
poor alice!
much could do, lying one side, look garden one eye; get hopeless ever: sat began cry again.
`you ought ashamed yourself,' said alice, `a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go crying way!
stop moment, tell you!'
went same, shedding gallons tears, large pool round her, four inches deep reaching half hall.
time heard little pattering feet distance, hastily dried eyes see coming.
white rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, pair white kid gloves one hand large fan other: came trotting along great hurry, muttering came, `oh!
duchess, duchess!
oh!
savage i've kept waiting!'
alice felt desperate ready ask help one; so, rabbit came near her, began, low, timid voice, `if please, sir--' rabbit started violently, dropped white kid gloves fan, skurried away darkness hard could go.
alice took fan gloves, and, hall hot, kept fanning time went talking: `dear, dear!
queer everything to-day!
yesterday things went usual.
wonder i've changed night?
let think: got morning?
almost think remember feeling little different.
i'm same, next question is, world i?
ah, that's great puzzle!'
began thinking children knew age herself, see could changed them.
`i'm sure i'm ada,' said, `for hair goes long ringlets, mine go ringlets all; i'm sure can't mabel, know sorts things, she, oh!
knows little!
besides, she, i'm i, and--oh dear, puzzling is!
i'll try know things used know.
let see: four times five twelve, four times six thirteen, four times seven is--oh dear!
shall never get twenty rate!
however, multiplication table signify: let's try geography.
london capital paris, paris capital rome, rome--no, that's wrong, i'm certain!
must changed mabel!
i'll try say "how doth little--"' crossed hands lap saying lessons, began repeat it, voice sounded hoarse strange, words come used do:-- `how doth little crocodile improve shining tail, pour waters nile every golden scale!
`how cheerfully seems grin, neatly spread claws, welcome little fishes gently smiling jaws!'
`i'm sure right words,' said poor alice, eyes filled tears went on, `i must mabel all, shall go live poky little house, next toys play with, oh!
ever many lessons learn!
no, i've made mind it; i'm mabel, i'll stay here!
it'll use putting heads saying "come again, dear!"
shall look say "who then?
tell first, then, like person, i'll come up: not, i'll stay till i'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!'
cried alice, sudden burst tears, `i wish would put heads down!
tired alone here!'
said looked hands, surprised see put one rabbit's little white kid gloves talking.
`how done that?'
thought.
`i must growing small again.'
got went table measure it, found that, nearly could guess, two feet high, going shrinking rapidly: soon found cause fan holding, dropped hastily, time avoid shrinking away altogether.
`that narrow escape!'
said alice, good deal frightened sudden change, glad find still existence; `and garden!'
ran speed back little door: but, alas!
little door shut again, little golden key lying glass table before, `and things worse ever,' thought poor child, `for never small before, never!
declare bad, is!'
said words foot slipped, another moment, splash!
chin salt water.
first idea somehow fallen sea, `and case go back railway,' said herself.
(alice seaside life, come general conclusion, wherever go english coast find number bathing machines sea, children digging sand wooden spades, row lodging houses, behind railway station.)
however, soon made pool tears wept nine feet high.
`i wish cried much!'
said alice, swam about, trying find way out.
`i shall punished now, suppose, drowned tears!
queer thing, sure!
however, everything queer to-day.'
heard something splashing pool little way off, swam nearer make was: first thought must walrus hippopotamus, remembered small now, soon made mouse slipped like herself.
`would use, now,' thought alice, `to speak mouse?
everything out-of-the-way here, think likely talk: rate, there's harm trying.'
began: `o mouse, know way pool?
tired swimming here, mouse!'
(alice thought must right way speaking mouse: never done thing before, remembered seen brother's latin grammar, `a mouse--of mouse--to mouse--a mouse--o mouse!'
mouse looked rather inquisitively, seemed wink one little eyes, said nothing.
`perhaps understand english,' thought alice; `i daresay french mouse, come william conqueror.'
(for, knowledge history, alice clear notion long ago anything happened.)
began again: `ou est chatte?'
first sentence french lesson-book.
mouse gave sudden leap water, seemed quiver fright.
`oh, beg pardon!'
cried alice hastily, afraid hurt poor animal's feelings.
`i quite forgot like cats.'
`not like cats!'
cried mouse, shrill, passionate voice.
`would like cats me?'
`well, perhaps not,' said alice soothing tone: `don't angry it.
yet wish could show cat dinah: think take fancy cats could see her.
dear quiet thing,' alice went on, half herself, swam lazily pool, `and sits purring nicely fire, licking paws washing face--and nice soft thing nurse--and capital one catching mice--oh, beg pardon!'
cried alice again, time mouse bristling over, felt certain must really offended.
`we talk rather not.'
`we indeed!'
cried mouse, trembling end tail.
`as would talk subject!
family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!
let hear name again!'
`i indeed!'
said alice, great hurry change subject conversation.
`are you--are fond--of--of dogs?'
mouse answer, alice went eagerly: `there nice little dog near house like show you!
little bright-eyed terrier, know, oh, long curly brown hair!
it'll fetch things throw them, it'll sit beg dinner, sorts things--i can't remember half them--and belongs farmer, know, says useful, worth hundred pounds!
says kills rats and--oh dear!'
cried alice sorrowful tone, `i'm afraid i've offended again!'
mouse swimming away hard could go, making quite commotion pool went.
called softly it, `mouse dear!
come back again, talk cats dogs either, like them!'
mouse heard this, turned round swam slowly back her: face quite pale (with passion, alice thought), said low trembling voice, `let us get shore, i'll tell history, understand hate cats dogs.'
high time go, pool getting quite crowded birds animals fallen it: duck dodo, lory eaglet, several curious creatures.
alice led way, whole party swam shore.
chapter iii caucus-race long tale indeed queer-looking party assembled bank--the birds draggled feathers, animals fur clinging close them, dripping wet, cross, uncomfortable.
first question course was, get dry again: consultation this, minutes seemed quite natural alice find talking familiarly them, known life.
indeed, quite long argument lory, last turned sulky, would say, `i older you, must know better'; alice would allow without knowing old was, and, lory positively refused tell age, said.
last mouse, seemed person authority among them, called out, `sit down, you, listen me!
i'll soon make dry enough!'
sat once, large ring, mouse middle.
alice kept eyes anxiously fixed it, felt sure would catch bad cold get dry soon.
`ahem!'
said mouse important air, `are ready?
driest thing know.
silence round, please!
"william conqueror, whose cause favoured pope, soon submitted english, wanted leaders, late much accustomed usurpation conquest.
edwin morcar, earls mercia northumbria--"' `ugh!'
said lory, shiver.
`i beg pardon!'
said mouse, frowning, politely: `did speak?'
`not i!'
said lory hastily.
`i thought did,' said mouse.
`--i proceed.
"edwin morcar, earls mercia northumbria, declared him: even stigand, patriotic archbishop canterbury, found advisable--"' `found what?'
said duck.
`found it,' mouse replied rather crossly: `of course know "it" means.'
`i know "it" means well enough, find thing,' said duck: `it's generally frog worm.
question is, archbishop find?'
mouse notice question, hurriedly went on, `"--found advisable go edgar atheling meet william offer crown.
william's conduct first moderate.
insolence normans--" getting now, dear?'
continued, turning alice spoke.
`as wet ever,' said alice melancholy tone: `it seem dry all.'
`in case,' said dodo solemnly, rising feet, `i move meeting adjourn, immediate adoption energetic remedies--' `speak english!'
said eaglet.
`i know meaning half long words, and, what's more, believe either!'
eaglet bent head hide smile: birds tittered audibly.
`what going say,' said dodo offended tone, `was, best thing get us dry would caucus-race.'
`what caucus-race?'
said alice; wanted much know, dodo paused thought somebody ought speak, one else seemed inclined say anything.
`why,' said dodo, `the best way explain it.'
(and, might like try thing yourself, winter day, tell dodo managed it.)
first marked race-course, sort circle, (`the exact shape matter,' said,) party placed along course, there.
`one, two, three, away,' began running liked, left liked, easy know race over.
however, running half hour so, quite dry again, dodo suddenly called `the race over!'
crowded round it, panting, asking, `but won?'
question dodo could answer without great deal thought, sat long time one finger pressed upon forehead (the position usually see shakespeare, pictures him), rest waited silence.
last dodo said, `everybody won, must prizes.'
`but give prizes?'
quite chorus voices asked.
`why, she, course,' said dodo, pointing alice one finger; whole party crowded round her, calling confused way, `prizes!
prizes!'
alice idea do, despair put hand pocket, pulled box comfits, (luckily salt water got it), handed round prizes.
exactly one a-piece round.
`but must prize herself, know,' said mouse.
`of course,' dodo replied gravely.
`what else got pocket?'
went on, turning alice.
`only thimble,' said alice sadly.
`hand here,' said dodo.
crowded round more, dodo solemnly presented thimble, saying `we beg acceptance elegant thimble'; and, finished short speech, cheered.
alice thought whole thing absurd, looked grave dare laugh; and, could think anything say, simply bowed, took thimble, looking solemn could.
next thing eat comfits: caused noise confusion, large birds complained could taste theirs, small ones choked patted back.
however, last, sat ring, begged mouse tell something more.
`you promised tell history, know,' said alice, `and hate--c d,' added whisper, half afraid would offended again.
`mine long sad tale!'
said mouse, turning alice, sighing.
`it long tail, certainly,' said alice, looking wonder mouse's tail; `but call sad?'
kept puzzling mouse speaking, idea tale something like this:-- `fury said mouse, met house, "let us go law: prosecute you.
--come, i'll take denial; must trial: really morning i've nothing do."
said mouse cur, "such trial, dear sir, jury judge, would wasting breath."
"i'll judge, i'll jury," said cunning old fury: "i'll try whole cause, condemn death."'
`you attending!'
said mouse alice severely.
`what thinking of?'
`i beg pardon,' said alice humbly: `you got fifth bend, think?'
`i not!'
cried mouse, sharply angrily.
`a knot!'
said alice, always ready make useful, looking anxiously her.
`oh, let help undo it!'
`i shall nothing sort,' said mouse, getting walking away.
`you insult talking nonsense!'
`i mean it!'
pleaded poor alice.
`but easily offended, know!'
mouse growled reply.
`please come back finish story!'
alice called it; others joined chorus, `yes, please do!'
mouse shook head impatiently, walked little quicker.
`what pity stay!'
sighed lory, soon quite sight; old crab took opportunity saying daughter `ah, dear!
let lesson never lose temper!'
`hold tongue, ma!'
said young crab, little snappishly.
`you're enough try patience oyster!'
`i wish dinah here, know do!'
said alice aloud, addressing nobody particular.
`she'd soon fetch back!'
`and dinah, might venture ask question?'
said lory.
alice replied eagerly, always ready talk pet: `dinah's cat.
capital one catching mice can't think!
oh, wish could see birds!
why, she'll eat little bird soon look it!'
speech caused remarkable sensation among party.
birds hurried once: one old magpie began wrapping carefully, remarking, `i really must getting home; night-air suit throat!'
canary called trembling voice children, `come away, dears!
high time bed!'
various pretexts moved off, alice soon left alone.
`i wish mentioned dinah!'
said melancholy tone.
`nobody seems like her, here, i'm sure best cat world!
oh, dear dinah!
wonder shall ever see more!'
poor alice began cry again, felt lonely low-spirited.
little while, however, heard little pattering footsteps distance, looked eagerly, half hoping mouse changed mind, coming back finish story.
chapter iv rabbit sends little bill white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, looking anxiously went, lost something; heard muttering `the duchess!
duchess!
oh dear paws!
oh fur whiskers!
she'll get executed, sure ferrets ferrets!
dropped them, wonder?'
alice guessed moment looking fan pair white kid gloves, good-naturedly began hunting them, nowhere seen--everything seemed changed since swim pool, great hall, glass table little door, vanished completely.
soon rabbit noticed alice, went hunting about, called angry tone, `why, mary ann, here?
run home moment, fetch pair gloves fan!
quick, now!'
alice much frightened ran direction pointed to, without trying explain mistake made.
`he took housemaid,' said ran.
`how surprised he'll finds am!
i'd better take fan gloves--that is, find them.'
said this, came upon neat little house, door bright brass plate name `w. rabbit' engraved upon it.
went without knocking, hurried upstairs, great fear lest meet real mary ann, turned house found fan gloves.
`how queer seems,' alice said herself, `to going messages rabbit!
suppose dinah'll sending messages next!'
began fancying sort thing would happen: `"miss alice!
come directly, get ready walk!"
"coming minute, nurse!
i've got see mouse get out."
think,' alice went on, `that they'd let dinah stop house began ordering people like that!'
time found way tidy little room table window, (as hoped) fan two three pairs tiny white kid gloves: took fan pair gloves, going leave room, eye fell upon little bottle stood near looking- glass.
label time words `drink me,' nevertheless uncorked put lips.
`i know something interesting sure happen,' said herself, `whenever eat drink anything; i'll see bottle does.
hope it'll make grow large again, really i'm quite tired tiny little thing!'
indeed, much sooner expected: drunk half bottle, found head pressing ceiling, stoop save neck broken.
hastily put bottle, saying `that's quite enough--i hope grow more--as is, can't get door--i wish drunk quite much!'
alas!
late wish that!
went growing, growing, soon kneel floor: another minute even room this, tried effect lying one elbow door, arm curled round head.
still went growing, and, last resource, put one arm window, one foot chimney, said `now more, whatever happens.
become me?'
luckily alice, little magic bottle full effect, grew larger: still uncomfortable, and, seemed sort chance ever getting room again, wonder felt unhappy.
`it much pleasanter home,' thought poor alice, `when one always growing larger smaller, ordered mice rabbits.
almost wish gone rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, know, sort life!
wonder happened me!
used read fairy-tales, fancied kind thing never happened, middle one!
ought book written me, ought!
grow up, i'll write one--but i'm grown now,' added sorrowful tone; `at least there's room grow here.'
`but then,' thought alice, `shall never get older now?
comfort, one way--never old woman- -but then--always lessons learn!
oh, like that!'
`oh, foolish alice!'
answered herself.
`how learn lessons here?
why, there's hardly room you, room lesson-books!'
went on, taking first one side other, making quite conversation altogether; minutes heard voice outside, stopped listen.
`mary ann!
mary ann!'
said voice.
`fetch gloves moment!'
came little pattering feet stairs.
alice knew rabbit coming look her, trembled till shook house, quite forgetting thousand times large rabbit, reason afraid it.
presently rabbit came door, tried open it; but, door opened inwards, alice's elbow pressed hard it, attempt proved failure.
alice heard say `then i'll go round get window.'
`that won't' thought alice, and, waiting till fancied heard rabbit window, suddenly spread hand, made snatch air.
get hold anything, heard little shriek fall, crash broken glass, concluded possible fallen cucumber-frame, something sort.
next came angry voice--the rabbit's--`pat!
pat!
you?'
voice never heard before, `sure i'm here!
digging apples, yer honour!'
`digging apples, indeed!'
said rabbit angrily.
`here!
come help this!'
(sounds broken glass.)
`now tell me, pat, what's window?'
`sure, arm, yer honour!'
(he pronounced `arrum.')
`an arm, goose!
ever saw one size?
why, fills whole window!'
`sure, does, yer honour: arm that.'
`well, got business there, rate: go take away!'
long silence this, alice could hear whispers then; as, `sure, like it, yer honour, all, all!'
`do tell you, coward!'
last spread hand again, made another snatch air.
time two little shrieks, sounds broken glass.
`what number cucumber-frames must be!'
thought alice.
`i wonder they'll next!
pulling window, wish could!
i'm sure want stay longer!'
waited time without hearing anything more: last came rumbling little cartwheels, sound good many voice talking together: made words: `where's ladder?--why, bring one; bill's got other--bill!
fetch here, lad!--here, put 'em corner--no, tie 'em together first--they reach half high enough yet--oh!
they'll well enough; particular- -here, bill!
catch hold rope--will roof bear?--mind loose slate--oh, coming down!
heads below!'
(a loud crash)--`now, that?--it bill, fancy--who's go chimney?--nay, shan't!
it!--that won't, then!--bill's go down--here, bill!
master says go chimney!'
`oh!
bill's got come chimney, he?'
said alice herself.
`shy, seem put everything upon bill!
bill's place good deal: fireplace narrow, sure; think kick little!'
drew foot far chimney could, waited till heard little animal (she guess sort was) scratching scrambling chimney close her: then, saying `this bill,' gave one sharp kick, waited see would happen next.
first thing heard general chorus `there goes bill!'
rabbit's voice along--`catch him, hedge!'
silence, another confusion voices--`hold head--brandy now--don't choke him--how it, old fellow?
happened you?
tell us it!'
last came little feeble, squeaking voice, (`that's bill,' thought alice,) `well, hardly know--no more, thank ye; i'm better now--but i'm deal flustered tell you--all know is, something comes like jack-in-the-box, goes like sky-rocket!'
`so did, old fellow!'
said others.
`we must burn house down!'
said rabbit's voice; alice called loud could, `if do.
i'll set dinah you!'
dead silence instantly, alice thought herself, `i wonder next!
sense, they'd take roof off.'
minute two, began moving again, alice heard rabbit say, `a barrowful do, begin with.'
`a barrowful what?'
thought alice; long doubt, next moment shower little pebbles came rattling window, hit face.
`i'll put stop this,' said herself, shouted out, `you'd better again!'
produced another dead silence.
alice noticed surprise pebbles turning little cakes lay floor, bright idea came head.
`if eat one cakes,' thought, `it's sure make change size; can't possibly make larger, must make smaller, suppose.'
swallowed one cakes, delighted find began shrinking directly.
soon small enough get door, ran house, found quite crowd little animals birds waiting outside.
poor little lizard, bill, middle, held two guinea-pigs, giving something bottle.
made rush alice moment appeared; ran hard could, soon found safe thick wood.
`the first thing i've got do,' said alice herself, wandered wood, `is grow right size again; second thing find way lovely garden.
think best plan.'
sounded excellent plan, doubt, neatly simply arranged; difficulty was, smallest idea set it; peering anxiously among trees, little sharp bark head made look great hurry.
enormous puppy looking large round eyes, feebly stretching one paw, trying touch her.
`poor little thing!'
said alice, coaxing tone, tried hard whistle it; terribly frightened time thought might hungry, case would likely eat spite coaxing.
hardly knowing did, picked little bit stick, held puppy; whereupon puppy jumped air feet once, yelp delight, rushed stick, made believe worry it; alice dodged behind great thistle, keep run over; moment appeared side, puppy made another rush stick, tumbled head heels hurry get hold it; alice, thinking like game play cart-horse, expecting every moment trampled feet, ran round thistle again; puppy began series short charges stick, running little way forwards time long way back, barking hoarsely while, till last sat good way off, panting, tongue hanging mouth, great eyes half shut.
seemed alice good opportunity making escape; set once, ran till quite tired breath, till puppy's bark sounded quite faint distance.
`and yet dear little puppy was!'
said alice, leant buttercup rest herself, fanned one leaves: `i liked teaching tricks much, if--if i'd right size it!
oh dear!
i'd nearly forgotten i've got grow again!
let see--how managed?
suppose ought eat drink something other; great question is, what?'
great question certainly was, what?
alice looked round flowers blades grass, see anything looked like right thing eat drink circumstances.
large mushroom growing near her, height herself; looked it, sides it, behind it, occurred might well look see top it.
stretched tiptoe, peeped edge mushroom, eyes immediately met large caterpillar, sitting top arms folded, quietly smoking long hookah, taking smallest notice anything else.
chapter v advice caterpillar caterpillar alice looked time silence: last caterpillar took hookah mouth, addressed languid, sleepy voice.
`who you?'
said caterpillar.
encouraging opening conversation.
alice replied, rather shyly, `i--i hardly know, sir, present-- least know got morning, think must changed several times since then.'
`what mean that?'
said caterpillar sternly.
`explain yourself!'
`i can't explain myself, i'm afraid, sir' said alice, `because i'm myself, see.'
`i see,' said caterpillar.
`i'm afraid can't put clearly,' alice replied politely, `for can't understand begin with; many different sizes day confusing.'
`it isn't,' said caterpillar.
`well, perhaps found yet,' said alice; `but turn chrysalis--you day, know--and butterfly, think feel little queer, you?'
`not bit,' said caterpillar.
`well, perhaps feelings may different,' said alice; `all know is, would feel queer me.'
`you!'
said caterpillar contemptuously.
`who you?'
brought back beginning conversation.
alice felt little irritated caterpillar's making short remarks, drew said, gravely, `i think, ought tell are, first.'
`why?'
said caterpillar.
another puzzling question; alice could think good reason, caterpillar seemed unpleasant state mind, turned away.
`come back!'
caterpillar called her.
`i've something important say!'
sounded promising, certainly: alice turned came back again.
`keep temper,' said caterpillar.
`is all?'
said alice, swallowing anger well could.
`no,' said caterpillar.
alice thought might well wait, nothing else do, perhaps might tell something worth hearing.
minutes puffed away without speaking, last unfolded arms, took hookah mouth again, said, `so think changed, you?'
`i'm afraid am, sir,' said alice; `i can't remember things used--and keep size ten minutes together!'
`can't remember things?'
said caterpillar.
`well, i've tried say "how doth little busy bee," came different!'
alice replied melancholy voice.
`repeat, "you old, father william,"' said caterpillar.
alice folded hands, began:-- `you old, father william,' young man said, `and hair become white; yet incessantly stand head-- think, age, right?'
`in youth,' father william replied son, `i feared might injure brain; but, i'm perfectly sure none, why, again.'
`you old,' said youth, `as mentioned before, grown uncommonly fat; yet turned back-somersault door-- pray, reason that?'
`in youth,' said sage, shook grey locks, `i kept limbs supple use ointment--one shilling box-- allow sell couple?'
`you old,' said youth, `and jaws weak anything tougher suet; yet finished goose, bones beak-- pray manage it?'
`in youth,' said father, `i took law, argued case wife; muscular strength, gave jaw, lasted rest life.'
`you old,' said youth, `one would hardly suppose eye steady ever; yet balanced eel end nose-- made awfully clever?'
`i answered three questions, enough,' said father; `don't give airs!
think listen day stuff?
off, i'll kick stairs!'
`that said right,' said caterpillar.
`not quite right, i'm afraid,' said alice, timidly; `some words got altered.'
`it wrong beginning end,' said caterpillar decidedly, silence minutes.
caterpillar first speak.
`what size want be?'
asked.
`oh, i'm particular size,' alice hastily replied; `only one like changing often, know.'
`i know,' said caterpillar.
alice said nothing: never much contradicted life before, felt losing temper.
`are content now?'
said caterpillar.
`well, like little larger, sir, mind,' said alice: `three inches wretched height be.'
`it good height indeed!'
said caterpillar angrily, rearing upright spoke (it exactly three inches high).
`but i'm used it!'
pleaded poor alice piteous tone.
thought herself, `i wish creatures easily offended!'
`you'll get used time,' said caterpillar; put hookah mouth began smoking again.
time alice waited patiently chose speak again.
minute two caterpillar took hookah mouth yawned twice, shook itself.
got mushroom, crawled away grass, merely remarking went, `one side make grow taller, side make grow shorter.'
`one side what?
side what?'
thought alice herself.
`of mushroom,' said caterpillar, asked aloud; another moment sight.
alice remained looking thoughtfully mushroom minute, trying make two sides it; perfectly round, found difficult question.
however, last stretched arms round far would go, broke bit edge hand.
`and which?'
said herself, nibbled little right-hand bit try effect: next moment felt violent blow underneath chin: struck foot!
good deal frightened sudden change, felt time lost, shrinking rapidly; set work eat bit.
chin pressed closely foot, hardly room open mouth; last, managed swallow morsel lefthand bit.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * `come, head's free last!'
said alice tone delight, changed alarm another moment, found shoulders nowhere found: could see, looked down, immense length neck, seemed rise like stalk sea green leaves lay far her.
`what green stuff be?'
said alice.
`and shoulders got to?
oh, poor hands, can't see you?'
moving spoke, result seemed follow, except little shaking among distant green leaves.
seemed chance getting hands head, tried get head them, delighted find neck would bend easily direction, like serpent.
succeeded curving graceful zigzag, going dive among leaves, found nothing tops trees wandering, sharp hiss made draw back hurry: large pigeon flown face, beating violently wings.
`serpent!'
screamed pigeon.
`i'm serpent!'
said alice indignantly.
`let alone!'
`serpent, say again!'
repeated pigeon, subdued tone, added kind sob, `i've tried every way, nothing seems suit them!'
`i least idea talking about,' said alice.
`i've tried roots trees, i've tried banks, i've tried hedges,' pigeon went on, without attending her; `but serpents!
there's pleasing them!'
alice puzzled, thought use saying anything till pigeon finished.
`as trouble enough hatching eggs,' said pigeon; `but must look-out serpents night day!
why, wink sleep three weeks!'
`i'm sorry annoyed,' said alice, beginning see meaning.
`and i'd taken highest tree wood,' continued pigeon, raising voice shriek, `and thinking free last, must needs come wriggling sky!
ugh, serpent!'
`but i'm serpent, tell you!'
said alice.
`i'm a--i'm a--' `well!
you?'
said pigeon.
`i see trying invent something!'
`i--i'm little girl,' said alice, rather doubtfully, remembered number changes gone day.
`a likely story indeed!'
said pigeon tone deepest contempt.
`i've seen good many little girls time, never one neck that!
no, no!
serpent; there's use denying it.
suppose telling next never tasted egg!'
`i tasted eggs, certainly,' said alice, truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite much serpents do, know.'
`i believe it,' said pigeon; `but do, they're kind serpent, that's say.'
new idea alice, quite silent minute two, gave pigeon opportunity adding, `you're looking eggs, know well enough; matter whether little girl serpent?'
`it matters good deal me,' said alice hastily; `but i'm looking eggs, happens; was, want yours: like raw.'
`well, off, then!'
said pigeon sulky tone, settled nest.
alice crouched among trees well could, neck kept getting entangled among branches, every stop untwist it.
remembered still held pieces mushroom hands, set work carefully, nibbling first one other, growing sometimes taller sometimes shorter, succeeded bringing usual height.
long since anything near right size, felt quite strange first; got used minutes, began talking herself, usual.
`come, there's half plan done now!
puzzling changes are!
i'm never sure i'm going be, one minute another!
however, i've got back right size: next thing is, get beautiful garden--how done, wonder?'
said this, came suddenly upon open place, little house four feet high.
`whoever lives there,' thought alice, `it'll never come upon size: why, frighten wits!'
began nibbling righthand bit again, venture go near house till brought nine inches high.
chapter vi pig pepper minute two stood looking house, wondering next, suddenly footman livery came running wood--(she considered footman livery: otherwise, judging face only, would called fish)--and rapped loudly door knuckles.
opened another footman livery, round face, large eyes like frog; footmen, alice noticed, powdered hair curled heads.
felt curious know about, crept little way wood listen.
fish-footman began producing arm great letter, nearly large himself, handed other, saying, solemn tone, `for duchess.
invitation queen play croquet.'
frog-footman repeated, solemn tone, changing order words little, `from queen.
invitation duchess play croquet.'
bowed low, curls got entangled together.
alice laughed much this, run back wood fear hearing her; next peeped fish-footman gone, sitting ground near door, staring stupidly sky.
alice went timidly door, knocked.
`there's sort use knocking,' said footman, `and two reasons.
first, i'm side door are; secondly, they're making noise inside, one could possibly hear you.'
certainly extraordinary noise going within--a constant howling sneezing, every great crash, dish kettle broken pieces.
`please, then,' said alice, `how get in?'
`there might sense knocking,' footman went without attending her, `if door us.
instance, inside, might knock, could let out, know.'
looking sky time speaking, alice thought decidedly uncivil.
`but perhaps can't help it,' said herself; `his eyes nearly top head.
rate might answer questions.--how get in?'
repeated, aloud.
`i shall sit here,' footman remarked, `till tomorrow--' moment door house opened, large plate came skimming out, straight footman's head: grazed nose, broke pieces one trees behind him.
`--or next day, maybe,' footman continued tone, exactly nothing happened.
`how get in?'
asked alice again, louder tone.
`are get all?'
said footman.
`that's first question, know.'
was, doubt: alice like told so.
`it's really dreadful,' muttered herself, `the way creatures argue.
enough drive one crazy!'
footman seemed think good opportunity repeating remark, variations.
`i shall sit here,' said, `on off, days days.'
`but do?'
said alice.
`anything like,' said footman, began whistling.
`oh, there's use talking him,' said alice desperately: `he's perfectly idiotic!'
opened door went in.
door led right large kitchen, full smoke one end other: duchess sitting three-legged stool middle, nursing baby; cook leaning fire, stirring large cauldron seemed full soup.
`there's certainly much pepper soup!'
alice said herself, well could sneezing.
certainly much air.
even duchess sneezed occasionally; baby, sneezing howling alternately without moment's pause.
things kitchen sneeze, cook, large cat sitting hearth grinning ear ear.
`please would tell me,' said alice, little timidly, quite sure whether good manners speak first, `why cat grins like that?'
`it's cheshire cat,' said duchess, `and that's why.
pig!'
said last word sudden violence alice quite jumped; saw another moment addressed baby, her, took courage, went again:-- `i know cheshire cats always grinned; fact, know cats could grin.'
`they can,' said duchess; `and 'em do.'
`i know do,' alice said politely, feeling quite pleased got conversation.
`you know much,' said duchess; `and that's fact.'
alice like tone remark, thought would well introduce subject conversation.
trying fix one, cook took cauldron soup fire, set work throwing everything within reach duchess baby --the fire-irons came first; followed shower saucepans, plates, dishes.
duchess took notice even hit her; baby howling much already, quite impossible say whether blows hurt not.
`oh, please mind doing!'
cried alice, jumping agony terror.
`oh, goes precious nose'; unusually large saucepan flew close it, nearly carried off.
`if everybody minded business,' duchess said hoarse growl, `the world would go round deal faster does.'
`which would advantage,' said alice, felt glad get opportunity showing little knowledge.
`just think work would make day night!
see earth takes twenty-four hours turn round axis--' `talking axes,' said duchess, `chop head!'
alice glanced rather anxiously cook, see meant take hint; cook busily stirring soup, seemed listening, went again: `twenty-four hours, think; twelve?
i--' `oh, bother me,' said duchess; `i never could abide figures!'
began nursing child again, singing sort lullaby so, giving violent shake end every line: `speak roughly little boy, beat sneezes: annoy, knows teases.'
chorus.
(in cook baby joined):-- `wow!
wow!
wow!'
duchess sang second verse song, kept tossing baby violently down, poor little thing howled so, alice could hardly hear words:-- `i speak severely boy, beat sneezes; thoroughly enjoy pepper pleases!'
chorus.
`wow!
wow!
wow!'
`here!
may nurse bit, like!'
duchess said alice, flinging baby spoke.
`i must go get ready play croquet queen,' hurried room.
cook threw frying-pan went out, missed her.
alice caught baby difficulty, queer- shaped little creature, held arms legs directions, `just like star-fish,' thought alice.
poor little thing snorting like steam-engine caught it, kept doubling straightening again, altogether, first minute two, much could hold it.
soon made proper way nursing it, (which twist sort knot, keep tight hold right ear left foot, prevent undoing itself,) carried open air.
`if take child away me,' thought alice, `they're sure kill day two: murder leave behind?'
said last words loud, little thing grunted reply (it left sneezing time).
`don't grunt,' said alice; `that's proper way expressing yourself.'
baby grunted again, alice looked anxiously face see matter it.
could doubt turn-up nose, much like snout real nose; also eyes getting extremely small baby: altogether alice like look thing all.
`but perhaps sobbing,' thought, looked eyes again, see tears.
no, tears.
`if going turn pig, dear,' said alice, seriously, `i'll nothing you.
mind now!'
poor little thing sobbed (or grunted, impossible say which), went silence.
alice beginning think herself, `now, creature get home?'
grunted again, violently, looked face alarm.
time could mistake it: neither less pig, felt would quite absurd carry further.
set little creature down, felt quite relieved see trot away quietly wood.
`if grown up,' said herself, `it would made dreadfully ugly child: makes rather handsome pig, think.'
began thinking children knew, might well pigs, saying herself, `if one knew right way change them--' little startled seeing cheshire cat sitting bough tree yards off.
cat grinned saw alice.
looked good- natured, thought: still long claws great many teeth, felt ought treated respect.
`cheshire puss,' began, rather timidly, know whether would like name: however, grinned little wider.
`come, pleased far,' thought alice, went on.
`would tell me, please, way ought go here?'
`that depends good deal want get to,' said cat.
`i much care where--' said alice.
`then matter way go,' said cat.
`--so long get somewhere,' alice added explanation.
`oh, sure that,' said cat, `if walk long enough.'
alice felt could denied, tried another question.
`what sort people live here?'
`in direction,' cat said, waving right paw round, `lives hatter: direction,' waving paw, `lives march hare.
visit either like: they're mad.'
`but want go among mad people,' alice remarked.
`oh, can't help that,' said cat: `we're mad here.
i'm mad.
mad.'
`how know i'm mad?'
said alice.
`you must be,' said cat, `or come here.'
alice think proved all; however, went `and know mad?'
`to begin with,' said cat, `a dog's mad.
grant that?'
`i suppose so,' said alice.
`well, then,' cat went on, `you see, dog growls angry, wags tail pleased.
growl i'm pleased, wag tail i'm angry.
therefore i'm mad.'
`i call purring, growling,' said alice.
`call like,' said cat.
`do play croquet queen to-day?'
`i like much,' said alice, `but invited yet.'
`you'll see there,' said cat, vanished.
alice much surprised this, getting used queer things happening.
looking place been, suddenly appeared again.
`by-the-bye, became baby?'
said cat.
`i'd nearly forgotten ask.'
`it turned pig,' alice quietly said, come back natural way.
`i thought would,' said cat, vanished again.
alice waited little, half expecting see again, appear, minute two walked direction march hare said live.
`i've seen hatters before,' said herself; `the march hare much interesting, perhaps may raving mad--at least mad march.'
said this, looked up, cat again, sitting branch tree.
`did say pig, fig?'
said cat.
`i said pig,' replied alice; `and wish keep appearing vanishing suddenly: make one quite giddy.'
`all right,' said cat; time vanished quite slowly, beginning end tail, ending grin, remained time rest gone.
`well!
i've often seen cat without grin,' thought alice; `but grin without cat!
curious thing ever say life!'
gone much farther came sight house march hare: thought must right house, chimneys shaped like ears roof thatched fur.
large house, like go nearer till nibbled lefthand bit mushroom, raised two feet high: even walked towards rather timidly, saying `suppose raving mad all!
almost wish i'd gone see hatter instead!'
chapter vii mad tea-party table set tree front house, march hare hatter tea it: dormouse sitting them, fast asleep, two using cushion, resting elbows it, talking head.
`very uncomfortable dormouse,' thought alice; `only, asleep, suppose mind.'
table large one, three crowded together one corner it: `no room!
room!'
cried saw alice coming.
`there's plenty room!'
said alice indignantly, sat large arm-chair one end table.
`have wine,' march hare said encouraging tone.
alice looked round table, nothing tea.
`i see wine,' remarked.
`there any,' said march hare.
`then civil offer it,' said alice angrily.
`it civil sit without invited,' said march hare.
`i know table,' said alice; `it's laid great many three.'
`your hair wants cutting,' said hatter.
looking alice time great curiosity, first speech.
`you learn make personal remarks,' alice said severity; `it's rude.'
hatter opened eyes wide hearing this; said was, `why raven like writing-desk?'
`come, shall fun now!'
thought alice.
`i'm glad they've begun asking riddles.--i believe guess that,' added aloud.
`do mean think find answer it?'
said march hare.
`exactly so,' said alice.
`then say mean,' march hare went on.
`i do,' alice hastily replied; `at least--at least mean say--that's thing, know.'
`not thing bit!'
said hatter.
`you might well say "i see eat" thing "i eat see"!'
`you might well say,' added march hare, `that "i like get" thing "i get like"!'
`you might well say,' added dormouse, seemed talking sleep, `that "i breathe sleep" thing "i sleep breathe"!'
`it thing you,' said hatter, conversation dropped, party sat silent minute, alice thought could remember ravens writing-desks, much.
hatter first break silence.
`what day month it?'
said, turning alice: taken watch pocket, looking uneasily, shaking every then, holding ear.
alice considered little, said `the fourth.'
`two days wrong!'
sighed hatter.
`i told butter suit works!'
added looking angrily march hare.
`it best butter,' march hare meekly replied.
`yes, crumbs must got well,' hatter grumbled: `you put bread-knife.'
march hare took watch looked gloomily: dipped cup tea, looked again: could think nothing better say first remark, `it best butter, know.'
alice looking shoulder curiosity.
`what funny watch!'
remarked.
`it tells day month, tell o'clock is!'
`why it?'
muttered hatter.
`does watch tell year is?'
`of course not,' alice replied readily: `but that's stays year long time together.'
`which case mine,' said hatter.
alice felt dreadfully puzzled.
hatter's remark seemed sort meaning it, yet certainly english.
`i quite understand you,' said, politely could.
`the dormouse asleep again,' said hatter, poured little hot tea upon nose.
dormouse shook head impatiently, said, without opening eyes, `of course, course; going remark myself.'
`have guessed riddle yet?'
hatter said, turning alice again.
`no, give up,' alice replied: `what's answer?'
`i slightest idea,' said hatter.
`nor i,' said march hare.
alice sighed wearily.
`i think might something better time,' said, `than waste asking riddles answers.'
`if knew time well do,' said hatter, `you talk wasting it.
him.'
`i know mean,' said alice.
`of course don't!'
hatter said, tossing head contemptuously.
`i dare say never even spoke time!'
`perhaps not,' alice cautiously replied: `but know beat time learn music.'
`ah!
accounts it,' said hatter.
`he stand beating.
now, kept good terms him, he'd almost anything liked clock.
instance, suppose nine o'clock morning, time begin lessons: whisper hint time, round goes clock twinkling!
half-past one, time dinner!'
(`i wish was,' march hare said whisper.)
`that would grand, certainly,' said alice thoughtfully: `but then--i hungry it, know.'
`not first, perhaps,' said hatter: `but could keep half-past one long liked.'
`is way manage?'
alice asked.
hatter shook head mournfully.
`not i!'
replied.
`we quarrelled last march--just went mad, know--' (pointing tea spoon march hare,) `--it great concert given queen hearts, sing "twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
wonder at!"
know song, perhaps?'
`i've heard something like it,' said alice.
`it goes on, know,' hatter continued, `in way:-- "up world fly, like tea-tray sky.
twinkle, twinkle--"' dormouse shook itself, began singing sleep `twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' went long pinch make stop.
`well, i'd hardly finished first verse,' said hatter, `when queen jumped bawled out, "he's murdering time!
head!"'
`how dreadfully savage!'
exclaimed alice.
`and ever since that,' hatter went mournful tone, `he thing ask!
always six o'clock now.'
bright idea came alice's head.
`is reason many tea-things put here?'
asked.
`yes, that's it,' said hatter sigh: `it's always tea-time, we've time wash things whiles.'
`then keep moving round, suppose?'
said alice.
`exactly so,' said hatter: `as things get used up.'
`but happens come beginning again?'
alice ventured ask.
`suppose change subject,' march hare interrupted, yawning.
`i'm getting tired this.
vote young lady tells us story.'
`i'm afraid know one,' said alice, rather alarmed proposal.
`then dormouse shall!'
cried.
`wake up, dormouse!'
pinched sides once.
dormouse slowly opened eyes.
`i asleep,' said hoarse, feeble voice: `i heard every word fellows saying.'
`tell us story!'
said march hare.
`yes, please do!'
pleaded alice.
`and quick it,' added hatter, `or asleep done.'
`once upon time three little sisters,' dormouse began great hurry; `and names elsie, lacie, tillie; lived bottom well--' `what live on?'
said alice, always took great interest questions eating drinking.
`they lived treacle,' said dormouse, thinking minute two.
`they done that, know,' alice gently remarked; `they'd ill.' `so were,' said dormouse; `very ill.' alice tried fancy extraordinary ways living would like, puzzled much, went on: `but live bottom well?'
`take tea,' march hare said alice, earnestly.
`i've nothing yet,' alice replied offended tone, `so can't take more.'
`you mean can't take less,' said hatter: `it's easy take nothing.'
`nobody asked opinion,' said alice.
`who's making personal remarks now?'
hatter asked triumphantly.
alice quite know say this: helped tea bread-and-butter, turned dormouse, repeated question.
`why live bottom well?'
dormouse took minute two think it, said, `it treacle-well.'
`there's thing!'
alice beginning angrily, hatter march hare went `sh!
sh!'
dormouse sulkily remarked, `if can't civil, better finish story yourself.'
`no, please go on!'
alice said humbly; `i interrupt again.
dare say may one.'
`one, indeed!'
said dormouse indignantly.
however, consented go on.
`and three little sisters--they learning draw, know--' `what draw?'
said alice, quite forgetting promise.
`treacle,' said dormouse, without considering time.
`i want clean cup,' interrupted hatter: `let's move one place on.'
moved spoke, dormouse followed him: march hare moved dormouse's place, alice rather unwillingly took place march hare.
hatter one got advantage change: alice good deal worse before, march hare upset milk-jug plate.
alice wish offend dormouse again, began cautiously: `but understand.
draw treacle from?'
`you draw water water-well,' said hatter; `so think could draw treacle treacle-well--eh, stupid?'
`but well,' alice said dormouse, choosing notice last remark.
`of course were', said dormouse; `--well in.'
answer confused poor alice, let dormouse go time without interrupting it.
`they learning draw,' dormouse went on, yawning rubbing eyes, getting sleepy; `and drew manner things--everything begins m--' `why m?'
said alice.
`why not?'
said march hare.
alice silent.
dormouse closed eyes time, going doze; but, pinched hatter, woke little shriek, went on: `--that begins m, mouse-traps, moon, memory, muchness-- know say things "much muchness"--did ever see thing drawing muchness?'
`really, ask me,' said alice, much confused, `i think--' `then talk,' said hatter.
piece rudeness alice could bear: got great disgust, walked off; dormouse fell asleep instantly, neither others took least notice going, though looked back twice, half hoping would call her: last time saw them, trying put dormouse teapot.
`at rate i'll never go again!'
said alice picked way wood.
`it's stupidest tea-party ever life!'
said this, noticed one trees door leading right it.
`that's curious!'
thought.
`but everything's curious today.
think may well go once.'
went.
found long hall, close little glass table.
`now, i'll manage better time,' said herself, began taking little golden key, unlocking door led garden.
went work nibbling mushroom (she kept piece pocked) till foot high: walked little passage: then--she found last beautiful garden, among bright flower-beds cool fountains.
chapter viii queen's croquet-ground large rose-tree stood near entrance garden: roses growing white, three gardeners it, busily painting red.
alice thought curious thing, went nearer watch them, came heard one say, `look now, five!
go splashing paint like that!'
`i help it,' said five, sulky tone; `seven jogged elbow.'
seven looked said, `that's right, five!
always lay blame others!'
`you'd better talk!'
said five.
`i heard queen say yesterday deserved beheaded!'
`what for?'
said one spoken first.
`that's none business, two!'
said seven.
`yes, business!'
said five, `and i'll tell him--it bringing cook tulip-roots instead onions.'
seven flung brush, begun `well, unjust things--' eye chanced fall upon alice, stood watching them, checked suddenly: others looked round also, bowed low.
`would tell me,' said alice, little timidly, `why painting roses?'
five seven said nothing, looked two.
two began low voice, `why fact is, see, miss, ought red rose-tree, put white one mistake; queen find out, heads cut off, know.
see, miss, we're best, afore comes, to--' moment five, anxiously looking across garden, called `the queen!
queen!'
three gardeners instantly threw flat upon faces.
sound many footsteps, alice looked round, eager see queen.
first came ten soldiers carrying clubs; shaped like three gardeners, oblong flat, hands feet corners: next ten courtiers; ornamented diamonds, walked two two, soldiers did.
came royal children; ten them, little dears came jumping merrily along hand hand, couples: ornamented hearts.
next came guests, mostly kings queens, among alice recognised white rabbit: talking hurried nervous manner, smiling everything said, went without noticing her.
followed knave hearts, carrying king's crown crimson velvet cushion; and, last grand procession, came king queen hearts.
alice rather doubtful whether ought lie face like three gardeners, could remember every heard rule processions; `and besides, would use procession,' thought she, `if people lie upon faces, see it?'
stood still was, waited.
procession came opposite alice, stopped looked her, queen said severely `who this?'
said knave hearts, bowed smiled reply.
`idiot!'
said queen, tossing head impatiently; and, turning alice, went on, `what's name, child?'
`my name alice, please majesty,' said alice politely; added, herself, `why, they're pack cards, all.
afraid them!'
`and these?'
said queen, pointing three gardeners lying round rosetree; for, see, lying faces, pattern backs rest pack, could tell whether gardeners, soldiers, courtiers, three children.
`how know?'
said alice, surprised courage.
`it's business mine.'
queen turned crimson fury, and, glaring moment like wild beast, screamed `off head!
off--' `nonsense!'
said alice, loudly decidedly, queen silent.
king laid hand upon arm, timidly said `consider, dear: child!'
queen turned angrily away him, said knave `turn over!'
knave so, carefully, one foot.
`get up!'
said queen, shrill, loud voice, three gardeners instantly jumped up, began bowing king, queen, royal children, everybody else.
`leave that!'
screamed queen.
`you make giddy.'
then, turning rose-tree, went on, `what here?'
`may please majesty,' said two, humble tone, going one knee spoke, `we trying--' `i see!'
said queen, meanwhile examining roses.
`off heads!'
procession moved on, three soldiers remaining behind execute unfortunate gardeners, ran alice protection.
`you beheaded!'
said alice, put large flower-pot stood near.
three soldiers wandered minute two, looking them, quietly marched others.
`are heads off?'
shouted queen.
`their heads gone, please majesty!'
soldiers shouted reply.
`that's right!'
shouted queen.
`can play croquet?'
soldiers silent, looked alice, question evidently meant her.
`yes!'
shouted alice.
`come on, then!'
roared queen, alice joined procession, wondering much would happen next.
`it's--it's fine day!'
said timid voice side.
walking white rabbit, peeping anxiously face.
`very,' said alice: `--where's duchess?'
`hush!
hush!'
said rabbit low, hurried tone.
looked anxiously shoulder spoke, raised upon tiptoe, put mouth close ear, whispered `she's sentence execution.'
`what for?'
said alice.
`did say "what pity!"?'
rabbit asked.
`no, didn't,' said alice: `i think pity.
said "what for?"'
`she boxed queen's ears--' rabbit began.
alice gave little scream laughter.
`oh, hush!'
rabbit whispered frightened tone.
`the queen hear you!
see, came rather late, queen said--' `get places!'
shouted queen voice thunder, people began running directions, tumbling other; however, got settled minute two, game began.
alice thought never seen curious croquet-ground life; ridges furrows; balls live hedgehogs, mallets live flamingoes, soldiers double stand hands feet, make arches.
chief difficulty alice found first managing flamingo: succeeded getting body tucked away, comfortably enough, arm, legs hanging down, generally, got neck nicely straightened out, going give hedgehog blow head, would twist round look face, puzzled expression could help bursting laughing: got head down, going begin again, provoking find hedgehog unrolled itself, act crawling away: besides this, generally ridge furrow way wherever wanted send hedgehog to, and, doubled-up soldiers always getting walking parts ground, alice soon came conclusion difficult game indeed.
players played without waiting turns, quarrelling while, fighting hedgehogs; short time queen furious passion, went stamping about, shouting `off head!'
`off head!'
minute.
alice began feel uneasy: sure, yet dispute queen, knew might happen minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become me?
they're dreadfully fond beheading people here; great wonder is, there's one left alive!'
looking way escape, wondering whether could get away without seen, noticed curious appearance air: puzzled much first, but, watching minute two, made grin, said `it's cheshire cat: shall somebody talk to.'
`how getting on?'
said cat, soon mouth enough speak with.
alice waited till eyes appeared, nodded.
`it's use speaking it,' thought, `till ears come, least one them.'
another minute whole head appeared, alice put flamingo, began account game, feeling glad someone listen her.
cat seemed think enough sight, appeared.
`i think play fairly,' alice began, rather complaining tone, `and quarrel dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and seem rules particular; least, are, nobody attends them--and idea confusing things alive; instance, there's arch i've got go next walking end ground--and croqueted queen's hedgehog now, ran away saw mine coming!'
`how like queen?'
said cat low voice.
`not all,' said alice: `she's extremely--' noticed queen close behind her, listening: went on, `--likely win, hardly worth finishing game.'
queen smiled passed on.
`who talking to?'
said king, going alice, looking cat's head great curiosity.
`it's friend mine--a cheshire cat,' said alice: `allow introduce it.'
`i like look all,' said king: `however, may kiss hand likes.'
`i'd rather not,' cat remarked.
`don't impertinent,' said king, `and look like that!'
got behind alice spoke.
`a cat may look king,' said alice.
`i've read book, remember where.'
`well, must removed,' said king decidedly, called queen, passing moment, `my dear!
wish would cat removed!'
queen one way settling difficulties, great small.
`off head!'
said, without even looking round.
`i'll fetch executioner myself,' said king eagerly, hurried off.
alice thought might well go back, see game going on, heard queen's voice distance, screaming passion.
already heard sentence three players executed missed turns, like look things all, game confusion never knew whether turn not.
went search hedgehog.
hedgehog engaged fight another hedgehog, seemed alice excellent opportunity croqueting one other: difficulty was, flamingo gone across side garden, alice could see trying helpless sort way fly tree.
time caught flamingo brought back, fight over, hedgehogs sight: `but matter much,' thought alice, `as arches gone side ground.'
tucked away arm, might escape again, went back little conversation friend.
got back cheshire cat, surprised find quite large crowd collected round it: dispute going executioner, king, queen, talking once, rest quite silent, looked uncomfortable.
moment alice appeared, appealed three settle question, repeated arguments her, though, spoke once, found hard indeed make exactly said.
executioner's argument was, cut head unless body cut from: never thing before, going begin time life.
king's argument was, anything head could beheaded, talk nonsense.
queen's argument was, something done less time she'd everybody executed, round.
(it last remark made whole party look grave anxious.)
alice could think nothing else say `it belongs duchess: better ask it.'
`she's prison,' queen said executioner: `fetch here.'
executioner went like arrow.
cat's head began fading away moment gone, and, time come back dutchess, entirely disappeared; king executioner ran wildly looking it, rest party went back game.
chapter ix mock turtle's story `you can't think glad see again, dear old thing!'
said duchess, tucked arm affectionately alice's, walked together.
alice glad find pleasant temper, thought perhaps pepper made savage met kitchen.
`when i'm duchess,' said herself, (not hopeful tone though), `i pepper kitchen all.
soup well without--maybe always pepper makes people hot-tempered,' went on, much pleased found new kind rule, `and vinegar makes sour--and camomile makes bitter--and--and barley-sugar things make children sweet-tempered.
wish people knew that: stingy it, know--' quite forgotten duchess time, little startled heard voice close ear.
`you're thinking something, dear, makes forget talk.
can't tell moral is, shall remember bit.'
`perhaps one,' alice ventured remark.
`tut, tut, child!'
said duchess.
`everything's got moral, find it.'
squeezed closer alice's side spoke.
alice much like keeping close her: first, duchess ugly; secondly, exactly right height rest chin upon alice's shoulder, uncomfortably sharp chin.
however, like rude, bore well could.
`the game's going rather better now,' said, way keeping conversation little.
`'tis so,' said duchess: `and moral is--"oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, makes world go round!"'
`somebody said,' alice whispered, `that done everybody minding business!'
`ah, well!
means much thing,' said duchess, digging sharp little chin alice's shoulder added, `and moral is--"take care sense, sounds take care themselves."'
`how fond finding morals things!'
alice thought herself.
`i dare say wondering put arm round waist,' duchess said pause: `the reason is, i'm doubtful temper flamingo.
shall try experiment?'
`he might bite,' alice cautiously replied, feeling anxious experiment tried.
`very true,' said duchess: `flamingoes mustard bite.
moral is--"birds feather flock together."'
`only mustard bird,' alice remarked.
`right, usual,' said duchess: `what clear way putting things!'
`it's mineral, think,' said alice.
`of course is,' said duchess, seemed ready agree everything alice said; `there's large mustard-mine near here.
moral is--"the mine, less yours."'
`oh, know!'
exclaimed alice, attended last remark, `it's vegetable.
look like one, is.'
`i quite agree you,' said duchess; `and moral is--"be would seem be"--or like put simply--"never imagine otherwise might appear others might otherwise would appeared otherwise."'
`i think understand better,' alice said politely, `if written down: can't quite follow say it.'
`that's nothing could say chose,' duchess replied, pleased tone.
`pray trouble say longer that,' said alice.
`oh, talk trouble!'
said duchess.
`i make present everything i've said yet.'
`a cheap sort present!'
thought alice.
`i'm glad give birthday presents like that!'
venture say loud.
`thinking again?'
duchess asked, another dig sharp little chin.
`i've right think,' said alice sharply, beginning feel little worried.
`just much right,' said duchess, `as pigs fly; m--' here, alice's great surprise, duchess's voice died away, even middle favourite word `moral,' arm linked began tremble.
alice looked up, stood queen front them, arms folded, frowning like thunderstorm.
`a fine day, majesty!'
duchess began low, weak voice.
`now, give fair warning,' shouted queen, stamping ground spoke; `either head must off, half time!
take choice!'
duchess took choice, gone moment.
`let's go game,' queen said alice; alice much frightened say word, slowly followed back croquet-ground.
guests taken advantage queen's absence, resting shade: however, moment saw her, hurried back game, queen merely remarking moment's delay would cost lives.
time playing queen never left quarrelling players, shouting `off head!'
`off head!'
sentenced taken custody soldiers, course leave arches this, end half hour arches left, players, except king, queen, alice, custody sentence execution.
queen left off, quite breath, said alice, `have seen mock turtle yet?'
`no,' said alice.
`i even know mock turtle is.'
`it's thing mock turtle soup made from,' said queen.
`i never saw one, heard one,' said alice.
`come on, then,' said queen, `and shall tell history,' walked together, alice heard king say low voice, company generally, `you pardoned.'
`come, that's good thing!'
said herself, felt quite unhappy number executions queen ordered.
soon came upon gryphon, lying fast asleep sun.
(if know gryphon is, look picture.)
`up, lazy thing!'
said queen, `and take young lady see mock turtle, hear history.
must go back see executions ordered'; walked off, leaving alice alone gryphon.
alice quite like look creature, whole thought would quite safe stay go savage queen: waited.
gryphon sat rubbed eyes: watched queen till sight: chuckled.
`what fun!'
said gryphon, half itself, half alice.
`what fun?'
said alice.
`why, she,' said gryphon.
`it's fancy, that: never executes nobody, know.
come on!'
`everybody says "come on!"
here,' thought alice, went slowly it: `i never ordered life, never!'
gone far saw mock turtle distance, sitting sad lonely little ledge rock, and, came nearer, alice could hear sighing heart would break.
pitied deeply.
`what sorrow?'
asked gryphon, gryphon answered, nearly words before, `it's fancy, that: got sorrow, know.
come on!'
went mock turtle, looked large eyes full tears, said nothing.
`this young lady,' said gryphon, `she wants know history, do.'
`i'll tell her,' said mock turtle deep, hollow tone: `sit down, you, speak word till i've finished.'
sat down, nobody spoke minutes.
alice thought herself, `i see even finish, begin.'
waited patiently.
`once,' said mock turtle last, deep sigh, `i real turtle.'
words followed long silence, broken occasional exclamation `hjckrrh!'
gryphon, constant heavy sobbing mock turtle.
alice nearly getting saying, `thank you, sir, interesting story,' could help thinking must come, sat still said nothing.
`when little,' mock turtle went last, calmly, though still sobbing little then, `we went school sea.
master old turtle--we used call tortoise--' `why call tortoise, one?'
alice asked.
`we called tortoise taught us,' said mock turtle angrily: `really dull!'
`you ought ashamed asking simple question,' added gryphon; sat silent looked poor alice, felt ready sink earth.
last gryphon said mock turtle, `drive on, old fellow!
day it!'
went words: `yes, went school sea, though mayn't believe it--' `i never said didn't!'
interrupted alice.
`you did,' said mock turtle.
`hold tongue!'
added gryphon, alice could speak again.
mock turtle went on.
`we best educations--in fact, went school every day--' `i've day-school, too,' said alice; `you proud that.'
`with extras?'
asked mock turtle little anxiously.
`yes,' said alice, `we learned french music.'
`and washing?'
said mock turtle.
`certainly not!'
said alice indignantly.
`ah!
really good school,' said mock turtle tone great relief.
`now end bill, "french, music, washing--extra."'
`you wanted much,' said alice; `living bottom sea.'
`i afford learn it.'
said mock turtle sigh.
`i took regular course.'
`what that?'
inquired alice.
`reeling writhing, course, begin with,' mock turtle replied; `and different branches arithmetic-- ambition, distraction, uglification, derision.'
`i never heard "uglification,"' alice ventured say.
`what it?'
gryphon lifted paws surprise.
`what!
never heard uglifying!'
exclaimed.
`you know beautify is, suppose?'
`yes,' said alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything-- prettier.'
`well, then,' gryphon went on, `if know uglify is, simpleton.'
alice feel encouraged ask questions it, turned mock turtle, said `what else learn?'
`well, mystery,' mock turtle replied, counting subjects flappers, `--mystery, ancient modern, seaography: drawling--the drawling-master old conger-eel, used come week: taught us drawling, stretching, fainting coils.'
`what like?'
said alice.
`well, can't show myself,' mock turtle said: `i'm stiff.
gryphon never learnt it.'
`hadn't time,' said gryphon: `i went classics master, though.
old crab, was.'
`i never went him,' mock turtle said sigh: `he taught laughing grief, used say.'
`so did, did,' said gryphon, sighing turn; creatures hid faces paws.
`and many hours day lessons?'
said alice, hurry change subject.
`ten hours first day,' said mock turtle: `nine next, on.'
`what curious plan!'
exclaimed alice.
`that's reason they're called lessons,' gryphon remarked: `because lessen day day.'
quite new idea alice, thought little made next remark.
`then eleventh day must holiday?'
`of course was,' said mock turtle.
`and manage twelfth?'
alice went eagerly.
`that's enough lessons,' gryphon interrupted decided tone: `tell something games now.'
chapter x lobster quadrille mock turtle sighed deeply, drew back one flapper across eyes.
looked alice, tried speak, minute two sobs choked voice.
`same bone throat,' said gryphon: set work shaking punching back.
last mock turtle recovered voice, and, tears running cheeks, went again:-- `you may lived much sea--' (`i haven't,' said alice)--`and perhaps never even introduced lobster--' (alice began say `i tasted--' checked hastily, said `no, never') `--so idea delightful thing lobster quadrille is!'
`no, indeed,' said alice.
`what sort dance it?'
`why,' said gryphon, `you first form line along sea-shore--' `two lines!'
cried mock turtle.
`seals, turtles, salmon, on; then, cleared jelly-fish way--' `that generally takes time,' interrupted gryphon.
`--you advance twice--' `each lobster partner!'
cried gryphon.
`of course,' mock turtle said: `advance twice, set partners--' `--change lobsters, retire order,' continued gryphon.
`then, know,' mock turtle went on, `you throw the--' `the lobsters!'
shouted gryphon, bound air.
`--as far sea can--' `swim them!'
screamed gryphon.
`turn somersault sea!'
cried mock turtle, capering wildly about.
`back land again, that's first figure,' said mock turtle, suddenly dropping voice; two creatures, jumping like mad things time, sat sadly quietly, looked alice.
`it must pretty dance,' said alice timidly.
`would like see little it?'
said mock turtle.
`very much indeed,' said alice.
`come, let's try first figure!'
said mock turtle gryphon.
`we without lobsters, know.
shall sing?'
`oh, sing,' said gryphon.
`i've forgotten words.'
began solemnly dancing round round alice, every treading toes passed close, waving forepaws mark time, mock turtle sang this, slowly sadly:-- `"will walk little faster?"
said whiting snail.
"there's porpoise close behind us, he's treading tail.
see eagerly lobsters turtles advance!
waiting shingle--will come join dance?
you, you, you, you, join dance?
you, you, you, you, join dance?
"you really notion delightful take us throw us, lobsters, sea!"
snail replied "too far, far!"
gave look askance-- said thanked whiting kindly, would join dance.
would not, could not, would not, could not, would join dance.
would not, could not, would not, could not, could join dance.
`"what matters far go?"
scaly friend replied.
"there another shore, know, upon side.
england nearer france-- turn pale, beloved snail, come join dance.
you, you, you, you, join dance?
you, you, you, you, join dance?"'
`thank you, interesting dance watch,' said alice, feeling glad last: `and like curious song whiting!'
`oh, whiting,' said mock turtle, `they--you've seen them, course?'
`yes,' said alice, `i've often seen dinn--' checked hastily.
`i know dinn may be,' said mock turtle, `but seen often, course know they're like.'
`i believe so,' alice replied thoughtfully.
`they tails mouths--and they're crumbs.'
`you're wrong crumbs,' said mock turtle: `crumbs would wash sea.
tails mouths; reason is--' mock turtle yawned shut eyes.--`tell reason that,' said gryphon.
`the reason is,' said gryphon, `that would go lobsters dance.
got thrown sea.
fall long way.
got tails fast mouths.
get again.
that's all.'
`thank you,' said alice, `it's interesting.
never knew much whiting before.'
`i tell that, like,' said gryphon.
`do know called whiting?'
`i never thought it,' said alice.
`why?'
`it boots shoes.'
gryphon replied solemnly.
alice thoroughly puzzled.
`does boots shoes!'
repeated wondering tone.
`why, shoes done with?'
said gryphon.
`i mean, makes shiny?'
alice looked them, considered little gave answer.
`they're done blacking, believe.'
`boots shoes sea,' gryphon went deep voice, `are done whiting.
know.'
`and made of?'
alice asked tone great curiosity.
`soles eels, course,' gryphon replied rather impatiently: `any shrimp could told that.'
`if i'd whiting,' said alice, whose thoughts still running song, `i'd said porpoise, "keep back, please: want us!"'
`they obliged them,' mock turtle said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without porpoise.'
`wouldn't really?'
said alice tone great surprise.
`of course not,' said mock turtle: `why, fish came me, told going journey, say "with porpoise?"'
`don't mean "purpose"?'
said alice.
`i mean say,' mock turtle replied offended tone.
gryphon added `come, let's hear adventures.'
`i could tell adventures--beginning morning,' said alice little timidly: `but use going back yesterday, different person then.'
`explain that,' said mock turtle.
`no, no!
adventures first,' said gryphon impatient tone: `explanations take dreadful time.'
alice began telling adventures time first saw white rabbit.
little nervous first, two creatures got close her, one side, opened eyes mouths wide, gained courage went on.
listeners perfectly quiet till got part repeating `you old, father william,' caterpillar, words coming different, mock turtle drew long breath, said `that's curious.'
`it's curious be,' said gryphon.
`it came different!'
mock turtle repeated thoughtfully.
`i like hear try repeat something now.
tell begin.'
looked gryphon thought kind authority alice.
`stand repeat "'tis voice sluggard,"' said gryphon.
`how creatures order one about, make one repeat lessons!'
thought alice; `i might well school once.'
however, got up, began repeat it, head full lobster quadrille, hardly knew saying, words came queer indeed:-- `'tis voice lobster; heard declare, "you baked brown, must sugar hair."
duck eyelids, nose trims belt buttons, turns toes.'
[later editions continued follows sands dry, gay lark, talk contemptuous tones shark, but, tide rises sharks around, voice timid tremulous sound.]
`that's different used say child,' said gryphon.
`well, never heard before,' said mock turtle; `but sounds uncommon nonsense.'
alice said nothing; sat face hands, wondering anything would ever happen natural way again.
`i like explained,' said mock turtle.
`she can't explain it,' said gryphon hastily.
`go next verse.'
`but toes?'
mock turtle persisted.
`how could turn nose, know?'
`it's first position dancing.'
alice said; dreadfully puzzled whole thing, longed change subject.
`go next verse,' gryphon repeated impatiently: `it begins "i passed garden."'
alice dare disobey, though felt sure would come wrong, went trembling voice:-- `i passed garden, marked, one eye, owl panther sharing pie--' [later editions continued follows panther took pie-crust, gravy, meat, owl dish share treat.
pie finished, owl, boon, kindly permitted pocket spoon: panther received knife fork growl, concluded banquet--] `what use repeating stuff,' mock turtle interrupted, `if explain go on?
far confusing thing ever heard!'
`yes, think better leave off,' said gryphon: alice glad so.
`shall try another figure lobster quadrille?'
gryphon went on.
`or would like mock turtle sing song?'
`oh, song, please, mock turtle would kind,' alice replied, eagerly gryphon said, rather offended tone, `hm!
accounting tastes!
sing "turtle soup," you, old fellow?'
mock turtle sighed deeply, began, voice sometimes choked sobs, sing this:-- `beautiful soup, rich green, waiting hot tureen!
dainties would stoop?
soup evening, beautiful soup!
soup evening, beautiful soup!
beau--ootiful soo--oop!
beau--ootiful soo--oop!
soo--oop e--e--evening, beautiful, beautiful soup!
`beautiful soup!

pennyworth beautiful soup?
beau--ootiful soo--oop!
beau--ootiful soo--oop!
soo--oop e--e--evening, beautiful, beauti--ful soup!'
`chorus again!'
cried gryphon, mock turtle begun repeat it, cry `the trial's beginning!'
heard distance.
`come on!'
cried gryphon, and, taking alice hand, hurried off, without waiting end song.
`what trial it?'
alice panted ran; gryphon answered `come on!'
ran faster, faintly came, carried breeze followed them, melancholy words:-- `soo--oop e--e--evening, beautiful, beautiful soup!'
chapter xi stole tarts?
king queen hearts seated throne arrived, great crowd assembled them--all sorts little birds beasts, well whole pack cards: knave standing them, chains, soldier side guard him; near king white rabbit, trumpet one hand, scroll parchment other.
middle court table, large dish tarts upon it: looked good, made alice quite hungry look them--`i wish they'd get trial done,' thought, `and hand round refreshments!'
seemed chance this, began looking everything her, pass away time.
alice never court justice before, read books, quite pleased find knew name nearly everything there.
`that's judge,' said herself, `because great wig.'
judge, way, king; wore crown wig, (look frontispiece want see it,) look comfortable, certainly becoming.
`and that's jury-box,' thought alice, `and twelve creatures,' (she obliged say `creatures,' see, animals, birds,) `i suppose jurors.'
said last word two three times herself, rather proud it: thought, rightly too, little girls age knew meaning all.
however, `jury-men' would done well.
twelve jurors writing busily slates.
`what doing?'
alice whispered gryphon.
`they can't anything put yet, trial's begun.'
`they're putting names,' gryphon whispered reply, `for fear forget end trial.'
`stupid things!'
alice began loud, indignant voice, stopped hastily, white rabbit cried out, `silence court!'
king put spectacles looked anxiously round, make talking.
alice could see, well looking shoulders, jurors writing `stupid things!'
slates, could even make one know spell `stupid,' ask neighbour tell him.
`a nice muddle slates'll trial's over!'
thought alice.
one jurors pencil squeaked.
course, alice could stand, went round court got behind him, soon found opportunity taking away.
quickly poor little juror (it bill, lizard) could make become it; so, hunting it, obliged write one finger rest day; little use, left mark slate.
`herald, read accusation!'
said king.
white rabbit blew three blasts trumpet, unrolled parchment scroll, read follows:-- `the queen hearts, made tarts, summer day: knave hearts, stole tarts, took quite away!'
`consider verdict,' king said jury.
`not yet, yet!'
rabbit hastily interrupted.
`there's great deal come that!'
`call first witness,' said king; white rabbit blew three blasts trumpet, called out, `first witness!'
first witness hatter.
came teacup one hand piece bread-and-butter other.
`i beg pardon, majesty,' began, `for bringing in: quite finished tea sent for.'
`you ought finished,' said king.
`when begin?'
hatter looked march hare, followed court, arm-in-arm dormouse.
`fourteenth march, think was,' said.
`fifteenth,' said march hare.
`sixteenth,' added dormouse.
`write down,' king said jury, jury eagerly wrote three dates slates, added up, reduced answer shillings pence.
`take hat,' king said hatter.
`it mine,' said hatter.
`stolen!'
king exclaimed, turning jury, instantly made memorandum fact.
`i keep sell,' hatter added explanation; `i've none own.
i'm hatter.'
queen put spectacles, began staring hatter, turned pale fidgeted.
`give evidence,' said king; `and nervous, i'll executed spot.'
seem encourage witness all: kept shifting one foot other, looking uneasily queen, confusion bit large piece teacup instead bread-and-butter.
moment alice felt curious sensation, puzzled good deal made was: beginning grow larger again, thought first would get leave court; second thoughts decided remain long room her.
`i wish squeeze so.'
said dormouse, sitting next her.
`i hardly breathe.'
`i can't help it,' said alice meekly: `i'm growing.'
`you've right grow here,' said dormouse.
`don't talk nonsense,' said alice boldly: `you know growing too.'
`yes, grow reasonable pace,' said dormouse: `not ridiculous fashion.'
got sulkily crossed side court.
time queen never left staring hatter, and, dormouse crossed court, said one officers court, `bring list singers last concert!'
wretched hatter trembled so, shook shoes off.
`give evidence,' king repeated angrily, `or i'll executed, whether nervous not.'
`i'm poor man, majesty,' hatter began, trembling voice, `--and begun tea--not week so--and bread-and-butter getting thin--and twinkling tea--' `the twinkling what?'
said king.
`it began tea,' hatter replied.
`of course twinkling begins t!'
said king sharply.
`do take dunce?
go on!'
`i'm poor man,' hatter went on, `and things twinkled that--only march hare said--' `i didn't!'
march hare interrupted great hurry.
`you did!'
said hatter.
`i deny it!'
said march hare.
`he denies it,' said king: `leave part.'
`well, rate, dormouse said--' hatter went on, looking anxiously round see would deny too: dormouse denied nothing, fast asleep.
`after that,' continued hatter, `i cut bread- and-butter--' `but dormouse say?'
one jury asked.
`that can't remember,' said hatter.
`you must remember,' remarked king, `or i'll executed.'
miserable hatter dropped teacup bread-and-butter, went one knee.
`i'm poor man, majesty,' began.
`you're poor speaker,' said king.
one guinea-pigs cheered, immediately suppressed officers court.
(as rather hard word, explain done.
large canvas bag, tied mouth strings: slipped guinea-pig, head first, sat upon it.)
`i'm glad i've seen done,' thought alice.
`i've often read newspapers, end trials, "there attempts applause, immediately suppressed officers court," never understood meant till now.'
`if that's know it, may stand down,' continued king.
`i can't go lower,' said hatter: `i'm floor, is.'
`then may sit down,' king replied.
guinea-pig cheered, suppressed.
`come, finished guinea-pigs!'
thought alice.
`now shall get better.'
`i'd rather finish tea,' said hatter, anxious look queen, reading list singers.
`you may go,' said king, hatter hurriedly left court, without even waiting put shoes on.
`--and take head outside,' queen added one officers: hatter sight officer could get door.
`call next witness!'
said king.
next witness duchess's cook.
carried pepper-box hand, alice guessed was, even got court, way people near door began sneezing once.
`give evidence,' said king.
`shan't,' said cook.
king looked anxiously white rabbit, said low voice, `your majesty must cross-examine witness.'
`well, must, must,' king said, melancholy air, and, folding arms frowning cook till eyes nearly sight, said deep voice, `what tarts made of?'
`pepper, mostly,' said cook.
`treacle,' said sleepy voice behind her.
`collar dormouse,' queen shrieked out.
`behead dormouse!
turn dormouse court!
suppress him!
pinch him!
whiskers!'
minutes whole court confusion, getting dormouse turned out, and, time settled again, cook disappeared.
`never mind!'
said king, air great relief.
`call next witness.'
added undertone queen, `really, dear, must cross-examine next witness.
quite makes forehead ache!'
alice watched white rabbit fumbled list, feeling curious see next witness would like, `--for got much evidence yet,' said herself.
imagine surprise, white rabbit read out, top shrill little voice, name `alice!'
chapter xii alice's evidence `here!'
cried alice, quite forgetting flurry moment large grown last minutes, jumped hurry tipped jury-box edge skirt, upsetting jurymen heads crowd below, lay sprawling about, reminding much globe goldfish accidentally upset week before.
`oh, beg pardon!'
exclaimed tone great dismay, began picking quickly could, accident goldfish kept running head, vague sort idea must collected put back jury-box, would die.
`the trial cannot proceed,' said king grave voice, `until jurymen back proper places-- all,' repeated great emphasis, looking hard alice said do.
alice looked jury-box, saw that, haste, put lizard head downwards, poor little thing waving tail melancholy way, quite unable move.
soon got again, put right; `not signifies much,' said herself; `i think would quite much use trial one way other.'
soon jury little recovered shock upset, slates pencils found handed back them, set work diligently write history accident, except lizard, seemed much overcome anything sit mouth open, gazing roof court.
`what know business?'
king said alice.
`nothing,' said alice.
`nothing whatever?'
persisted king.
`nothing whatever,' said alice.
`that's important,' king said, turning jury.
beginning write slates, white rabbit interrupted: `unimportant, majesty means, course,' said respectful tone, frowning making faces spoke.
`unimportant, course, meant,' king hastily said, went undertone, `important--unimportant-- unimportant--important--' trying word sounded best.
jury wrote `important,' `unimportant.'
alice could see this, near enough look slates; `but matter bit,' thought herself.
moment king, time busily writing note-book, cackled `silence!'
read book, `rule forty-two.
persons mile high leave court.'
everybody looked alice.
`i'm mile high,' said alice.
`you are,' said king.
`nearly two miles high,' added queen.
`well, go, rate,' said alice: `besides, that's regular rule: invented now.'
`it's oldest rule book,' said king.
`then ought number one,' said alice.
king turned pale, shut note-book hastily.
`consider verdict,' said jury, low, trembling voice.
`there's evidence come yet, please majesty,' said white rabbit, jumping great hurry; `this paper picked up.'
`what's it?'
said queen.
`i opened yet,' said white rabbit, `but seems letter, written prisoner to--to somebody.'
`it must that,' said king, `unless written nobody, usual, know.'
`who directed to?'
said one jurymen.
`it directed all,' said white rabbit; `in fact, there's nothing written outside.'
unfolded paper spoke, added `it letter, all: set verses.'
`are prisoner's handwriting?'
asked another jurymen.
`no, they're not,' said white rabbit, `and that's queerest thing it.'
(the jury looked puzzled.)
`he must imitated somebody else's hand,' said king.
(the jury brightened again.)
`please majesty,' said knave, `i write it, can't prove did: there's name signed end.'
`if sign it,' said king, `that makes matter worse.
must meant mischief, else signed name like honest man.'
general clapping hands this: first really clever thing king said day.
`that proves guilt,' said queen.
`it proves nothing sort!'
said alice.
`why, even know they're about!'
`read them,' said king.
white rabbit put spectacles.
`where shall begin, please majesty?'
asked.
`begin beginning,' king said gravely, `and go till come end: stop.'
verses white rabbit read:-- `they told her, mentioned him: gave good character, said could swim.
sent word gone (we know true): push matter on, would become you?
gave one, gave two, gave us three more; returned you, though mine before.
chance involved affair, trusts set free, exactly were.

`that's important piece evidence we've heard yet,' said king, rubbing hands; `so let jury--' `if one explain it,' said alice, (she grown large last minutes bit afraid interrupting him,) `i'll give sixpence.
_i_ believe there's atom meaning it.'
jury wrote slates, `she believe there's atom meaning it,' none attempted explain paper.
`if there's meaning it,' said king, `that saves world trouble, know, try find any.
yet know,' went on, spreading verses knee, looking one eye; `i seem see meaning them, all. "
--said could swim--" can't swim, you?'
added, turning knave.
knave shook head sadly.
`do look like it?'
said.
(which certainly not, made entirely cardboard.)
`all right, far,' said king, went muttering verses himself: `"we know true--" that's jury, course-- "i gave one, gave two--" why, must tarts, know--' `but, goes "they returned you,"' said alice.
`why, are!'
said king triumphantly, pointing tarts table.
`nothing clearer that.
again--"before fit--" never fits, dear, think?'
said queen.
`never!'
said queen furiously, throwing inkstand lizard spoke.
(the unfortunate little bill left writing slate one finger, found made mark; hastily began again, using ink, trickling face, long lasted.)
`then words fit you,' said king, looking round court smile.
dead silence.
`it's pun!'
king added offended tone, everybody laughed, `let jury consider verdict,' king said, twentieth time day.
`no, no!'
said queen.
`sentence first--verdict afterwards.'
`stuff nonsense!'
said alice loudly.
`the idea sentence first!'
`hold tongue!'
said queen, turning purple.
`i won't!'
said alice.
`off head!'
queen shouted top voice.
nobody moved.
`who cares you?'
said alice, (she grown full size time.)
`you're nothing pack cards!'
whole pack rose air, came flying upon her: gave little scream, half fright half anger, tried beat off, found lying bank, head lap sister, gently brushing away dead leaves fluttered trees upon face.
`wake up, alice dear!'
said sister; `why, long sleep had!'
`oh, i've curious dream!'
said alice, told sister, well could remember them, strange adventures reading about; finished, sister kissed her, said, `it curious dream, dear, certainly: run tea; getting late.'
alice got ran off, thinking ran, well might, wonderful dream been.
sister sat still left her, leaning head hand, watching setting sun, thinking little alice wonderful adventures, till began dreaming fashion, dream:-- first, dreamed little alice herself, tiny hands clasped upon knee, bright eager eyes looking hers--she could hear tones voice, see queer little toss head keep back wandering hair would always get eyes--and still listened, seemed listen, whole place around became alive strange creatures little sister's dream.
long grass rustled feet white rabbit hurried by--the frightened mouse splashed way neighbouring pool--she could hear rattle teacups march hare friends shared never-ending meal, shrill voice queen ordering unfortunate guests execution--once pig-baby sneezing duchess's knee, plates dishes crashed around it--once shriek gryphon, squeaking lizard's slate-pencil, choking suppressed guinea-pigs, filled air, mixed distant sobs miserable mock turtle.

lastly, pictured little sister would, after-time, grown woman; would keep, riper years, simple loving heart childhood: would gather little children, make eyes bright eager many strange tale, perhaps even dream wonderland long ago: would feel simple sorrows, find pleasure simple joys, remembering child-life, happy summer days.
